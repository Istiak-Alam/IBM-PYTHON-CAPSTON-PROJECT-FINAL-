## ðŸ“ˆ Approach
1. **Data Collection** â€“ Gathered datasets from job posting websites via web scraping, APIs, and public CSV/Excel files.  
2. **Data Wrangling** â€“ Standardized formats, handled missing values, and removed duplicates using pandas/numpy.  
3. **EDA** â€“ Applied statistical methods and visualizations (box plots, histograms, scatter plots) to uncover patterns.  
4. **Visualization & Dashboarding** â€“ Built dashboards in Google Looker Studio and IBM Cognos Analytics.  
5. **Storytelling** â€“ Presented findings and recommendations in a PowerPoint report.
